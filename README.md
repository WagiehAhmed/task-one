# Blogging Platform API

## Scalability Plan

To ensure the blogging platform API can handle 1 million users efficiently, we adopt a multi-faceted approach that includes database optimization, load balancing, and caching strategies. Below are the details:

### Database Optimization
To manage a large number of users and interactions (posts, comments, likes), we ensure the database can scale horizontally. This involves partitioning (sharding) the database across multiple servers, grouping related data based on user or post IDs. This approach minimizes the risk of bottlenecking on a single server. Additionally, indexing frequently queried fields such as user IDs, post IDs, and timestamps speeds up query performance. For read-heavy workloads (e.g., fetching posts and comments), a read replica setup will be used, where one primary database handles write operations and multiple replicas serve read queries.

### Load Balancing
To ensure high availability and distribute incoming traffic effectively, we use a load balancer (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancer or Nginx). This will route traffic across multiple application instances, preventing overloading of any single server and improving uptime. As traffic grows, auto-scaling will dynamically add or remove application instances based on demand. Sticky sessions can also be used for authentication, ensuring users are consistently directed to the same instance after logging in.

### Caching Strategies
To reduce the load on the database, especially for frequently accessed data like popular posts and comments, an in-memory cache like Redis is employed. This caches posts, user profiles, and like counts, reducing the need to query the database for each request. Cache invalidation strategies, such as time-to-live (TTL) or event-based invalidation (e.g., when a post or comment is updated), ensure that stale data does not persist in the cache. Additionally, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) can be used to cache static assets (images, CSS, etc.) at the edge, reducing load times and lowering traffic to the main servers.

With these strategies in place, the API is designed to scale effectively as user demand increases, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience for 1 million users.


## API Documentation

The full API documentation for the Blogging Platform can be found below. It includes detailed information about all available endpoints, request/response formats, and examples for interacting with the API:

You can use this link to explore the API, test various endpoints, and see example requests and responses. It will help you understand the API's functionality and guide you in integrating with it.



## setup

This project is a RESTful API designed for a blogging platform. It includes features for user authentication, CRUD operations for blog posts and comments, as well as "like" functionality for posts and comments. The API is built using **Node.js** with **Express**, **Prisma ORM**, and **JWT** for authentication.

## Features
- User authentication (signup, login, logout) using JWT.
- CRUD operations for blog posts (create, read, update, delete).
- CRUD operations for comments on posts.
- "Like" functionality for posts and comments.
- Secure endpoints with proper error handling and validation.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up the Blogging Platform API on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **MySQL** (or a compatible database)
- **npm** or **yarn** (for managing dependencies)

### Steps to Set Up the Project

1. **Clone the repository**
